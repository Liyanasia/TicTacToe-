Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. 
The player who succeeds in placing their marks (either 'X' or 'O') in a horizontal, vertical
, or diagonal row wins the game. If all spaces are filled and no player has achieved a win, the game is a draw.

i made a new flutter app and usd the main.dart file to create this game i then ran the code flutter run lib/main.dart and it came in the terminal.
